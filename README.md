    git clone https://github.com/jscsscom/tailwindcss-cn.git
    ```

2. Go into the project root directory

    ```sh
    cd tailwindcss-cn
    ```

3. Install JS dependencies

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

4. Start the dev server

    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

5. Export static pages

    ```sh
    yarn export
    ```

6. Push to github

    ```sh
    git push origin master
    ```

7. Deploy

The documents will automatically deploy to Github pages.
